# Florida Hackers Initiatives

(This is a beta. Descriptions and processes are subject to change.)
This README explains how to get started with being able to propose an initiative, and how to get it part of Florida Hackers.

# What is Florida Hackers?

We are a regional community dedicated to helping grow the hacker culture in Florida, connect creators across the state, promote community building, and leave our sunshine state a little brighter than before. In order to accomplish this goal- we need your help to contribute your verse to this community.

# What Is A FH-Inititive

A proposal that is undertaken by members of the Florida Hackers community where hackers like you can contribute and the mission.

It can be anything from asking to document the stories of hackers, to proposing to handle travel to even hosting a conference. Anyone can do anything as long as they are willing to document and propose the work to be completed. The idea's are up to you.

Any Florida Hacker can propose ideas, calls for organizers, and events- all you have to do is submit a pull request. Before it can be an initiative- there must be a proposal with a clear roadmap + goal. Don't worry, we will get into how to make a suggestion.

[We would love to see you on the Slack!](https://floridahackers.slack.com/signup)

# How do I submit a proposal?

Fork the repo, copy the sample-proposal.md and name the markdown file the name of yours and fill out the questions. Submit a pull request and start a discussion. Feel free to invite a friend or the community. 

# It gets approved, what next?

You will get access to open up a repo for your project and get access to our logo and branding assets. A Slack channel will be made to help organize your communication. We will do our best to help you out.

### Happy Hacking!
